# Football Or Not

A computer vision project to classify images as either "football" or "not football" (basketball) using FastAI and deep learning. This project demonstrates dataset creation, model training, and prediction visualization in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Structure

- `Football Or Not.ipynb`: Main notebook for data collection, training, and evaluation.
- `football/`, `basketball/`: Directories for downloaded images.

## Features
- Downloads images using DuckDuckGo search.
- Cleans and resizes images.
- Trains a ResNet18 classifier with FastAI.
- Visualizes predictions and results.
